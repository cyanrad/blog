# My First Post
**Hello, World!**
Here, on this beautiful piece of the internet I'm simply going to post
all sorts of things and on whatever I think is interesting enough to show the world

And the first of which is going to be about how I made blog post site

It's made using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) a static site generator built with go.
their slogan *"The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites"* is well deserved,
this is the fastest I've ever "built" a website and thanks to the [terminal theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/) by [pnar](https://github.com/panr)
it's definelty the nicest looking one (never let a backend engineer do frontend design XD)


## Why HUGO
As an overengineer, it would only take slightly a bit more than an eternity to create a simple site to post stuff.
So, knowing my weakness, I opted to go with the simplest approach, that being HUGO.

It's a very popular static site generator, with beautiful looking frontend that a backend engineer would
never dream of designing, but it remains simple and to the point, I mean the whole thing is a cli tool*.
and it's built with go, so if I ever need to get my hands dirty I'd be more than capable

Creating my own site from scratch would just lead to a spiral
HUGO is probably the best tool for this job
of overengineering, frustration, and more crying than what I would like to admit.

Hugo seems like the best tool for the job since I wanted to reduce the friction of creating
a site to as little as possible, so instead of overengineering my site (something I tend to unconsously do) and it
taking weeks to realse I just wanted to get something initial out and quickl.

# Useful Reources I Used
[HUGO's basic guides](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) are guides to the basics...
[Luke Smith's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I) is a great place to start as it covers more practical grounds
