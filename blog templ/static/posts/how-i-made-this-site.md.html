<h1 id="my-first-post">My First Post</h1>
<p><strong>Hello, World!</strong> Here, on this beautiful piece of the
internet I’m simply going to post all sorts of things and on whatever I
think is interesting enough to show the world</p>
<p>And the first of which is going to be about how I made blog post
site</p>
<p>It’s made using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">HUGO</a> a static site
generator built with go. their slogan <em>“The world’s fastest framework
for building websites”</em> is well deserved, this is the fastest I’ve
ever “built” a website and thanks to the <a
href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/">terminal
theme</a> by <a href="https://github.com/panr">pnar</a> it’s definelty
the nicest looking one (never let a backend engineer do frontend design
XD)</p>
<h2 id="why-hugo">Why HUGO</h2>
<p>As an overengineer, it would only take slightly a bit more than an
eternity to create a simple site to post stuff. So, knowing my weakness,
I opted to go with the simplest approach, that being HUGO.</p>
<p>It’s a very popular static site generator, with beautiful looking
frontend that a backend engineer would never dream of designing, but it
remains simple and to the point, I mean the whole thing is a cli tool*.
and it’s built with go, so if I ever need to get my hands dirty I’d be
more than capable</p>
<p>Creating my own site from scratch would just lead to a spiral HUGO is
probably the best tool for this job of overengineering, frustration, and
more crying than what I would like to admit.</p>
<p>Hugo seems like the best tool for the job since I wanted to reduce
the friction of creating a site to as little as possible, so instead of
overengineering my site (something I tend to unconsously do) and it
taking weeks to realse I just wanted to get something initial out and
quickl. &gt; still can’t come up with a good joke -_- (choose one of the
above paragraphs)</p>

<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">HUGO’s basic
guides</a> are guides to the basics… <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I">Luke Smith’s
guide</a> is a great place to start as it covers more practical
grounds</p>
